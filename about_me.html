        <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Jennifer Morales. I currently live in Marietta, GA
            with my husband, Carlos and our little dog, Bruce. My in-laws recently
            moved in with us as well. It probably goes without saying, we are currently
            in the market for a larger home.</p>

        <h2>Things I enjoy doing</h2>
            
        <p>Carlos and I are big foodies and love going out to eat and trying 
            new restaurants. We also enjoy taking our dog for walks along the Chattahoochee River.
            We have recently started to travel and have really enjoyed that and
            are looking forward to doing a lot more traveling in the future. I also really
            enjoy watching football and soccer. 
        </p>

        <h2> Why I came to Digital Crafts</h2>
        <p>My last position was working as a technical assistance in an 
            environmental testing laboratory. It was a small company with no room for growth.
            I realized that my career had hit a dead end. My husband is a web developer 
            and I see everyday how much he enjoys his job. We also have several friends in the
            tech industry and they all love working in tech. I feel like web development
            works well with my educational background plus it's something that I know
            I will love doing. I'm excited to be at Digital Crafts and start my new career.
